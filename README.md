Predictive OS Resource Allocation
Project Overview
Predictive OS Resource Allocation is a system that monitors real-time system metrics and predicts resource usage for the operating system using machine learning algorithms. The main goal is to proactively allocate system resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network based on predicted future usage to avoid performance degradation or system overload.
This system collects data such as CPU, memory, disk usage, and network statistics, processes and trains machine learning models using historical data, and then uses the model to predict the future resource usage. If the predictions show that any resource will exceed its threshold, an alert is triggered, allowing the user to take preemptive action.

Features
1.	Real-Time Resource Monitoring:
o	Monitors CPU, memory, disk, and network usage in real-time.
2.	Predictive Analytics:
o	Uses machine learning to predict the future utilization of system resources.
3.	Alert System:
o	Sends alerts when resource usage exceeds predefined thresholds.
4.	Data Visualization:
o	Graphically displays real-time resource usage and predicted trends.
5.	Logging & Analysis:
o	Logs past resource data for further analysis and model improvement.

Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to get your local development environment set up:
1.	Clone the Repository:
bash
CopyEdit
git clone https://github.com/sathvicreddy/Predictive-OS-Resource-Allocation/tree/main
cd Predictive-OS-Resource-Allocation
2.	Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed, then install the required dependencies:
bash
CopyEdit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3.	Run the System:
After installing the dependencies, you can run the system using:
bash
CopyEdit
python main.py
This will start monitoring system resources, predicting future usage, and displaying alerts when thresholds are reached.
How It Works
1.	Data Collection:
The system gathers real-time resource usage statistics (CPU, memory, disk, network) every few seconds using psutil.
2.	Preprocessing:
The collected data is cleaned and preprocessed using pandas to handle any missing values and normalize the data to make it suitable for training the machine learning model.
3.	Machine Learning Model:
We use regression models from scikit-learn to predict future resource usage based on historical data. The model is trained on the collected system data and updated periodically to improve predictions.
4.	Prediction and Alert:
Once trained, the model makes predictions for upcoming resource utilization. If any of the resources are predicted to exceed a threshold (e.g., 80% CPU usage), the system triggers an alert.
5.	Visualization:
The system also displays real-time and predicted resource usage trends using interactive plots generated by matplotlib and seaborn.
